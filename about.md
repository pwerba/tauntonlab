#Research Summary

Jack Taunton focuses on the design and discovery of chemical tools to selectively modulate proteins in living cells, with the aim of inventing small molecules that demystify complex cellular processes relevant to human disease. He is also interested in the mechanisms by which signaling proteins assemble on membrane surfaces to control cytoskeletal and membrane dynamics.
